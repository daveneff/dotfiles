# dotfiles

This is my experimenting with dotfiles for machine configuration.

## Installation

For a new OS X development environment, run the following to install:

    git clone https://github.com/daveneff/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    sh setup.sh

This script does the following:

 - Installs any missing tools 
 - Installs preferred applications
 - Installs zsh and oh-my-zsh
 - Creates symlinks to config files
